These are CP/M programs that run on an Altair 8800 with CP/M. 

Programs may run on an 8080 or Z80 CPU. Please specify if a Z80 is necessary. 

Also, while we'll accept any compatible CP/M program, we'd like to get
programs patched for the VT-100 terminal. If you have several versions, please
contribute the VT-100, if possible.

At this point, we are not accepting CPM-86 software or programs that cannot run
on the Altair 8800.

The AltairDuino mini-Altair system is available from Adwater & Stir
https://www.adwaterandstir.com/

The Altair Clone, a full size case with a PIC-based Altair emulation 
can be purchased from Mike Douglas at:
http://altairclone.com/

Mike also has a fantastic "getting started" library at 
http://altairclone.com/support.htm

Finally, RunCPM shoudl be able to run most of the programs here. This 
may be the best modern CP/M implementation I've come across, and it can
be run on a PC or microcontroller like the Arduino, Teensy, or ESP32.

I would also love to see these programs run and tested on RC2014 and 
other homebrew Z80 computers.
