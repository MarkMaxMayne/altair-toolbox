# altair-toolbox
Utilities, games, and docs for the Altair 8800, IMSAI 8080, and compatible CP/M computers. 

The Altair Toolbox is located at https://github.com/tomxp411/altair-toolbox

This is a collection of free software, with a focus on CP/M programs that can run on the Altair 8800 and IMSAI 8080. 
This is a _software preservation project_ with the chief goal of preserving these programs for future generations.

# contributing

Fork this repository, add your item, and create a pull request. Once your request is accepted, feel free to delete your local fork. 
(This will always be here.) If you DO keep a local fork, please pull regularly from this fork, so yours doesn't get 
too far behind.

I'd prefer uploads as loose files (ie: COM, TXT, ASM). Include disk images as links in the README for your upload. 
If the upload only makes sense as a disk image (ie: boot disks), then upload the disk image directly.

Disk images should use the Tarbell 8" floppy format used by the Altair Clone and Altairduino emulators. This is a 330K
file and should either be readable on CP/M 2.2 or directly bootable.

For programs intended to run on the front panel or from tape, feel free to include a HEX file or a binary file that can be
streamed to the Altair's serial port. 

All uploads must include:
1. The creator's name (where available)
2. License terms
3. If the creator is unknown, the contributor (your name) and (if possible) where you acquired the software.

While every effort is made to ensure that only public domain or free software is available here, a non-free program may
sneak its way in. Please use the "Issues" link to request a takedown when this happens. We will remove the program from
the archive.
