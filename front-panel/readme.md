These are programs meant to run directly on the Altair or IMSAI without an operating system.

Programs too large to easily key in should be provided in Intel HEX format, where possible, to 
allow direct upload to an emualtor.

If the program is meant to be keyed in to an Altair, Octal is preferred. Hex is preferred for the 
IMSAI 8080.

When possible, please include source code, and _please_, include the name of the assembler
used to assemble the code.
