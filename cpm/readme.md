These are CP/M programs that run on an Altair 8800 with CP/M. 

Programs may run on an 8080 or Z80 CPU. Please specify if a Z80 is necessary. 

Also, while we'll accept any compatible CP/M program, we'd like to get
programs patched for the VT-100 terminal. If you have several versions, please
contribute the VT-100, if possible.

At this point, we are not accepting CPM-86 software or programs that cannot run
on the Altair 8800.
