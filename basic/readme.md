This is a collection of BASIC programs.

Programs may be targeted for any popular BASIC interpreter, 
with a focus on MS BASIC-80 and BBC BASIC Z80. 

Other BASIC programs will also be accepted, as long as they run under 
a common and popular platform. Examples include GWBASIC/BASICA on PC, 
Microsoft BASIC 2 for CBM, BBC BASIC, or ZX BASIC on the Spectrum.

Programs should be submitted in ASCII readable text format. Please
do not submit snapshots, disk images, or tokenized binary files.

To save a program as ASCII in Microsoft BASIC, use the command
SAVE "FILENAME.BAS",A

To save a program as ASCII in BBC BASIC, use CONVERT.COM. This
will automatically convert between BBC and BAS files. 

Commodore BASIC programs can be converted to plain text files with
PETCAT, available in the VICE emulator.

Please strip out extra lines at teh bottom of your program, especially
if it was transferred from a CP/M computer and has junk below the ^Z 
end of file character.

Please note in the top of your program which version of BASIC it
runs under and the license. 

Example:

` 10 REM SPACE WAR FOR BASIC-80 5.0
` 20 REM (C) 2019 TOM WILSON CC BY-SA-NC 

Creative Commons is a good fit for BASIC source code. 
The preferred license here is Attribution (CC BY). 
Share-Alike (SA) is okay, as is Non-Commercial (NC). 
The full designation would be CC BY-SA-NC for all three together.

GPL, BSD, MIT, or other open source licenses are also acceptable.

We will not accept "no derivatives" licenses; BASIC programs will 
inevatibly need to be modified for new platforms, and we want to see
these programs made available as far as possible into the future.
