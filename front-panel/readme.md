These are programs meant to run directly on the Altair or IMSAI without an operating system.

Programs too large to easily key in should be provided in Intel HEX format, where possible, to 
allow direct upload to an emualtor.

Assembly listings with the assemled code (ie: PRN files) are preferred for any program
small enough to key in.

When possible, please include source code, and _please_, include the name of the assembler
used to assemble the code.
